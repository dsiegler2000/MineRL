# MineRL
This is a project with all of my work for the [MineRL](http://minerl.io/docs/) competition. 
I am not entering into the competition, rather, I am building this agent for The Agency, 
Georgia Tech's AI and ML club. Currently I am using a Double DQN agent, but I haven't yet trained
it fully or tested much, though the agent does run in the MineRL environment.
